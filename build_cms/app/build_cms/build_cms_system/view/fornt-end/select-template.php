        <h1>Build-CMS</h1>
        <p>
            thanks for choosing Build-CMS as your CMS
        </p>
        <p>
            the only thing that is left to do is to select a template and in order to do that, you have to migrate the CMS using the DEV tool with the install-cms command.
            After that is done you can select, install or create a template to use.
        </p>
        <p>In order to change the template you have to go to the <a href="<?php echo config_url::BASE("/admin"); ?>">back-end</a></p>
